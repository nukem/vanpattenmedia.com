New York City-based percussionist Jeremy Yaddaw was looking to spruce up his website, basing it around new photography shot by 35mm’s Matthew Murphy (we interviewed Murphy at our blog).

We built a site that captured the rustic, gritty aesthetic of the photography and highlighted it in a fullscreen display behind Jeremy’s content (that he can edit himself with WordPress). The photos are impossible to miss, and they make Jeremy’s news, bio, resume, and other content look better than ever.

It’s also fully responsive, so it looks great on the biggest desktops and the smallest cell phones.
