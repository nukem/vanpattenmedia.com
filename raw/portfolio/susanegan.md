Broadway, film, and TV veteran **Susan Egan** approached us with the initial mockups for a new website, and needed our help to make them into a usable website. Egan has had a web presence for years and has accumulated a large catalog of photos, videos, audio clips, and press clippings that had to be translated into a totally new and fresh look.

Our first fully HTML5 site, we married our own design sensibility with the look of the existing mockup to create the final site. All of the formerly-static content is now in WordPress, where Susan can easily manage it herself.
