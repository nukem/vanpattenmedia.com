![][1]Here at Van Patten Media, we love the theatre and the entertainment biz. Many of our clients are theatre pros from every department: musicians, actors, singers, and business people.

We were curious though: how did they get their start? What steps did they take to build their careers? And did they have any advice for up-and-comers? With these questions, [**How I Booked It**][2] was born.

[**How I Booked It**][2] is a new website that documents how those clients (and other cool theatre pros) got their start, and shares the advice they have to the next generation. We’ll be interviewing people from every job in theatre at every level (Broadway, off-Broadway, tours, regional, etc.), so you’ll see all the opportunities available.

Technically speaking, the site is fully responsive so you’ll get a top-notch experience on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers alike. It’s powered by the latest version of WordPress.

[We started off by interviewing Jeremy Yaddaw][3] (a client) who shares his thoughts on the journey to becoming a professional musician in NYC. It’s definitely worth a read. Be sure to **tune in every Tuesday** at [howibookedit.com][2] for future interviews!

P.S. You can sponsor an interview on **How I Booked It**! We’ll include your blurb in the post for all eternity, as well as on our homepage for one week, and we’ll share your link on Twitter and Facebook. [Contact us for more details.][4]
