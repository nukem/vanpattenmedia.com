[![][2]][2]I’ve talked a bit on this blog [about my love of customising the WordPress admin panel][2]. It’s an excellent way of improving your experience with WordPress and making it easier (and more fun) to maintain your site.

In addition to our [impending ebook that will cover the topic][3], I thought a series of short screencasts might help inspire you to customise your own projects. I’ll show you some customisations that we’ve done, as well as guide you through code snippets and plugins that can help you customise your own projects.

You can watch the first screencast in the series, covering a cool custom widget we built, below.
