It’s been months in the making, but we’re so thrilled to announce the official release of **[Total Slider 1.1][1]**, the latest and greatest version of our slider plugin for WordPress. If you’re not familiar with what Total Slider is, pop over to the **[Total Slider project page][1]** and check out the details.

If you are familiar with Total Slider, and are already an avid user, you’ll be excited to hear about the changes we’ve made in this release. Lead Developer Peter Upfold has been hard at work on a number of incredible new features, and I (Chief Annoyance and Design Consultant-on-Occasion Chris) have been spending time building some nifty new built-in themes.



### Changes

Among the changes in Total Slider 1.1 are:

*   Support for multiple slide templates. For the first time, you can have different slide groups use different slide templates! Even on the same page. Cool. Template developers will want to read our [documentation explaining the changes][2].
*   Speaking of templates, we’ve built in two new ones: Twenty Twelve and Twenty Twelve (Alternate). They perfectly complement WordPress’ new [default Twenty Twelve theme][3], if I do say so myself (and as I designed them, I do).
*   Finally, official shortcode support! We released “secret” shortcode support previously, but now it’s official with a TinyMCE button and everything.
*   Even Better WYSIWYG! I’m particularly excited about this one.  Previously, our WYSIWYG was predicated on template developers using the DOM structure we had previously set up. Now—template developers rejoice—you can use any structure you want! (*The geeky explanation:* we now “compile” the template PHP into an EJS template, so it truly reflects what you’ve coded. Cool, huh?)
*   We’ve also fixed a number of bugs, and made some under-the-hood changes.

Sounds great, doesn’t it? It is! If you’re interested in checking it out, upgrade your existing Total Slider install ([remembering to upgrade your template if you need to][2]) or [install Total Slider for the first time][1] and give it a spin.

We think you’ll love it!
