Just recently, I returned from a trip abroad. The bulk of the trip was in Italy (Rome and Naples) but just before I came back to snowy Buffalo I decided to take a detour to London.

Initially it was just a chance to see [Matilda The Musical][1] (an exuberant, delightful piece of musical theatre if ever there was one), but it quickly became clear there was another objective for this British detour: after nearly seven years of working together, I would finally have the opportunity to meet [Peter Upfold][2], Van Patten Media’s lead developer, in person.

Although the meeting was relatively quick, we were able to grab coffee and tea, catch up on our respective lives outside of work, and begin brainstorming a new Van Patten Media project (more about that soon).

I’m thrilled to have been able to make the connection in person, and I can only hope this is the first of many such opportunities. I had a blast in London, and am already eagerly planning my return!
