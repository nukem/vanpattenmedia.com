![][1]We’re so proud to have been apart of [35mm: A Musical Exhibition][2], the new work of musical theatre by [Ryan Scott Oliver][3] inspired by the photography of [Matthew Murphy][4].

Don’t know what 35mm is? [We interviewed Matthew Murphy][5] back in February, and here’s how he described it:

> “*35mm* is collaboration between myself and composer Ryan Scott Oliver.  It is an evening-length work that merges the worlds of musical theater and photography.”

We’re so excited that this exciting new show was preserved in a cast album, and that the cast album is now available to purchase! You can find it on [iTunes][6] or buy a physical copy from [Ghostlight Records][7]. You’ll also get a beautiful 48 page booklet (digital or on paper) with the photos that inspired the songs, so you can get the full visual experience.

I just got my copy of the CD yesterday, and it’s an incredible recording. The cast and band are phenomenal, the arrangements are crisp and tight, and it’s a delight to listen to.

I’m so happy we were able to contribute to the production, and look forward to doing the same for other new theatre productions in the future!
