We had a short hiatus from the Week In Review while various projects took priority. Never fear though, we’re back and with a vengeance.

We have lots to share from this week (and from last) so strap in and let’s look back over the last seven days in Van Patten Media land!

### Recently…

*   **Monday, February 27:** Need a solution for white-labeling the WordPress admin panel? Check out vpm-custom-admin, a quick and dirty plugin designed to help you do just that. It’s not available through the WordPress directory as it’s designed to be edited and customized for each use, but you can [find it on Github][2].
*   **Wednesday, March 7:** We released our first official WordPress plugins! Peter’s brilliant solution for supporting SSL in the WordPress admin panel when you’re using custom domains in Multisite was finally made available on the WordPress plugin directory. The plugins (it’s a two part solution) were developed for an internal project that never came to fruition. We’re happy to share the results with the WordPress community! [Read more about it at Van Patten Media Labs][3].
*   **Wednesday, March 7:** “35mm: A Musical Exhibition” opened in New York City! We’re so excited to be on the team of this incredible new musical, and we’ll be in the city on Monday to see it. We’ve also just added a performance on Wednesday, March 14th so [grab your tickets now][4]!
