Slightly late: here’s the latest edition of VPM’s **Week in Review**! All the fun’s after the jump, so read on…

### Notable happenings:

*   **Rach5**, our custom-built WordPress theme boilerplate, got a whole slew of updates (and there are even more in the pipeline). Some of the changes are documented at [Van Patten Media Labs][1], our home for open source stuff we build.
*   Tickets to **[35mm][2]**, the new musical we’re a proud part of, are [now on sale][3]! Get your tickets soon–they’re going to go quickly!
*   We welcomed February with news from [Pingdom][4] (one of our server monitoring providers) that we had 99.9% uptime on our server in January. **How cool is that?**

### We liked…

*   Ever wondered what the namesake of **[Rach5][6]** is? It’s a silly music joke, referencing the composer [Rachmaninoff’s][7] piano concertos. He wrote four, and they’re often colloquially referred to as Rach 1, 2, 3, and 4. **[Here’s the most famous, Rach 3][8]**, played by virtuoso pianist [Vladimir Horowitz][9].
*   Are you still an avid [Delicious][10] user [like I am][11]? Frustrated that the Chrome extension doesn’t fully support the new comma-separated tags? I took apart the extension, figured out how to fix it, and **[posted a walkthrough at my blog][12]**.
*   I can’t say enough about the importance of sleep, and [FreelanceSwitch][13] helps explain **[why it’s so critical for freelancers][14]**.
