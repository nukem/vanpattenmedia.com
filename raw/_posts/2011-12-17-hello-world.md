Hey there world! It’s been a year and too-many-revisions-to-count in the making, but we’re thrilled to finally be able to unveil our new website to you. If you’re reading this, you’re looking at it!

Built on Rach5, our internal WordPress theme boilerplate, the new look is completely custom and tailor-made for WordPress 3.3. We have a number of cool technologies under the hood:

*   **Google Web Fonts** powers the fancy typography. We’re using the light and semi-bold variants of Anna Giedryś’ delightful [Signika Negative][1]
*   JavaScript is loaded by **LAB.js**
*   **jQuery** is on hand for some effects, like the [fixed position header][2] (scroll down, desktop users) and the [fader][3] on the front page
*   And it’s built in floor-to-ceiling HTML5, the latest iteration of the HTML spec!

I am so proud of this new look. It represents the exciting future of Van Patten Media, and I hope you like it too!
