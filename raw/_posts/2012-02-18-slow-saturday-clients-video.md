![Illustration of a film reel][1]Over the past week, we’ve had a lot of behind-the-scenes developments, but not much we can share publicly. That’s the bad news. The good news? The introduction of a new recurring feature: **Slow Saturday**! On weeks like this, where we don’t have much to share about the previous week, we’ll share what our clients have been working on instead.

This inaugural edition of Slow Saturday features **cool projects our clients have put together on video**.

### Nina Doesn’t Care

First, we’re going back in time a bit to share **[Susan Egan][2]**‘s “[Nina Doesn’t Care][3]” in honor of Susan’s birthday today! This is a hilarious video about Susan’s daughter who just isn’t phased by her mom’s star status.

### Meet the Newsies

We have no idea how **[Andrew Keenan-Bolger][4]** finds time to perform on Broadway *and* create hilarious web videos, but he constantly surprises us with his apparently boundless creativity.

His new miniseries, “[Meet the Newsies][5],” takes you backstage at Disney’s [Newsies on Broadway][6], where he is performing the role of Crutchie. Perhaps not-so-coincidentally, Crutchie is the first newsie to be highlighted in the “Meet the Newsies” series.
