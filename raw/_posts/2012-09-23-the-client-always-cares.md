It’s easy to get frustrated with clients. They’re often demanding about simple things. They’ll treat their project like its the only one that matters and have you go through endless revisions and ask endless questions about inane details.

It is harder to remember though that to the client, their project *is *the only one that matters. To them, their business, project, or idea is their world, and they’ve trusted you to help contribute to their bottom line (in some small way). They’re giving up control, and those endless revisions and endless questions are a way for them to ensure they have a stake in the process.

Don’t forget to have humility and empathy so you can understand your client’s position. The demands, questions, and revisions are not designed to frustrate you. Instead, hear them as requests for reassurance. Exude confidence in your knowledge and skill set. Show that you’ve thought your decisions through. Prove that you have considered every angle of their problem, just as they have.

The client always cares. **And so should you.**
