I’ve been hunting for the perfect issue tracker for a few years now. I’ve tried them all, from self-hosted open source projects to enterprise-level software-as-a-service applications. None of them felt quite right though. Some were too bloated, others were missing key features I needed. I had started to think I’d need to build my own, when I stumbled on [DoneDone][1], a wonderful service from Chicago-based [We Are Mammoth][2] that turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.  
  
DoneDone is a C# webapp (we’ll forgive it though) that makes it easy to track issues in projects. That’s not too remarkable. There are hundreds of SaaS issue trackers on the web.

There are a few things about DoneDone that make it particularly great though:

1.  **Simple design.** Tools like Redmine and other issue trackers offer suffer from cluttered designs. DoneDone’s interface is simple, colorful, and easy to navigate around.
2.  **Simple featureset.** To some, this might be a downside, but to me this is great. Other (unnamed) issue trackers are subject to serious feature bloat, but DoneDone has trimmed the fat (or not even bothered to include it). It’s just what we need: nothing more.
3.  **Great plans**. Unlike other more expensive solutions, DoneDone has awesome affordable plans that all include unlimited plans. This is excellent for a bootstrapped business like us. We need to save where we can!
4.  **Stellar support.** Even if any of the other elements were missing, the support would probably more than make up for it (fortunately, it has it all!). DoneDone’s support response has been excellent at their [GetSatisfaction forum][3]. I’ve nagged them with questions, feature requests, and other concerns and they’ve been friendly and helpful every time.

If you’re looking for an excellent issue tracker that avoids bloat, with excellent support and stellar design, [check out DoneDone][1]. I can’t recommend it highly enough!
