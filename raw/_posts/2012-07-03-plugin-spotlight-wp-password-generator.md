Strong passwords are key when it comes to security. In fact, the strength of your password can be the difference between a hack and a foiled hacker.

[WP Password Generator][1] is an awesome little plugin for WordPress that allows you to quickly generate secure, completely random passwords. By adding a simple “generate password” button in your user profile area (in both adding or editing mode), WP Password Generator gives you the quick ability to create passwords that will keep hackers guessing for a long time.

When paired with a password manager like [1Password][2], WP Password Generator really shines. You can easily generate random passwords right in line with WP Password Generator, and then save them in 1Password (or your [manager of choice][3]) so you don’t need to remember the long convoluted string of characters. It’s a great way to boost security.
