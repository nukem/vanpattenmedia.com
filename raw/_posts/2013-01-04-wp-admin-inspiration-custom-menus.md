One of our favourite customisations is tweaking the admin panel menus. We’re all used to the usual few menus: “Posts”, “Links”, “Media”, etc. But if you think about it, many of those options aren’t relevant to your website, and certainly aren’t relevant to your clients. Fortunately, there’s an easy fix. With the power of the plugin [Admin Menu Editor][7] (or WordPress’s [native functions][8]) you can customise these menus to fit exactly to the site you’re building.
