I was so lucky to have the opportunity to speak at WordCamp Toronto: Developers last Sunday on a topic I’m very passionate about: customising the WordPress admin panel so it’s focused on clients and tailored to the site you’ve built.



![][1]Toronto is one of my favorite cities to visit (a short drive from my home base in Buffalo) and it was especially great to meet the WordPress community across the border.

My talk, “Developing a Client-Focused Admin Panel” touched on some of the philosophies and ethics behind tweaking the admin panel so it’s focused on the folks who will use it (not just you, Mr./Mrs. Tech Guru). I also provided examples of some of the cool ways you can customise the admin panel. For example, you can **add dashboard widgets**, **remove unneeded menu items**, **change the footer tex**t, and **restyle the login area**. And that’s only the beginning!

I put [code on Github][2] demonstrating how to do everything I showed (and more), and also have my slides [available on Speaker Deck][3].

**I’m also turning the talk into a short eBook!** That will be available hopefully in the next few weeks. You can sign up for [notifications about the eBook by clicking here][4] or checking out the embedded form below.
