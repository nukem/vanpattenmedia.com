Hey there Van Patten Media fans!

Inspired by [Harvest][1]‘s weekly “[Playback][2],” we’ve decided to start sharing more about what we’re doing, reading, and learning on a week-to-week basis. It will be a healthy mix of business and pleasure, so be sure to read through for the full experience.

### This week…

*   **Friday, January 20**: We launched **[35mmTheMusical.com][3]**, the official website of “35mm,” a multimedia musical by composer **[Ryan Scott Oliver][4]** and photographer **[Matthew Murphy][5]**. We’re thrilled to be above-the-title, supporting this incredible production. Stay tuned to the blog for more details.
*   **Saturday, January 21**: Peter open-sourced **VSPB**, or the **[Very Simple PayPal Bridge][6]**. From his post at [Van Patten Media Labs][7]…  
    > The [Very Simple PayPal Bridge][8] is a PHP class that, as the name suggests, provides a very simple interface for the PayPal NVP API.
    > 
    > In any situation where you need to interface more directly with the PayPal API, the VSPB provides a clean interface for the other layers of your code[...] It is great as a lower-level component of a wider PHP e-commerce solution.

*   **Tuesday, January 24**: We got into the thick of feasibility testing for an upcoming project. Hint: it involves WordPress multisite, and will be totally awesome.
*   **Wednesday, January 25**: Paid a visit to Buffalo OpenCoffee, Suburbs Edition (the inaugural event, no less). We’re thrilled to have the chance talk tech and startups with the Buffalo community.

### We liked…

**Chris:**

*   Laura Marling’s “[Sophia][9]” was on repeat pretty consistently throughout the week.
*   Lifehack.org’s [article on becoming “clutter-free”][10] is a must read, especially for those of us who are, well, let’s say… organizationally-challenged.
*   Jeff White of [Kula Partners][11] posted a lengthy summary of his talk on “[Starting a business][12],” a talk he just gave at Podcamp Halifax 2012. A lot of the specifics are geared toward Canadian readers, but the overall themes apply to every would-be entrepreneur.

**Peter:**

*   Cloud productivity provider Zoho [experienced a major outage][13] at the beginning of the week. Ultimately, it was [their response][13] to it — open, honest, and in refreshing detail — that reflected really well on the company.
*   The BBC [reminds us][14] of the human cost of our shiny electronic gadgets, and that we could all be doing more to put pressure on the manufacturers on the issue of conflict minerals.
*   Once again, Ubuntu [shows some real innovation in user interface design][15] for their upcoming 12.04 release. It remains to be seen how well [the new HUD][16] works in practice, of course.
