After I spoke about [Customising the WordPress admin panel in Toronto][1], I gave a modified version of the same talk to our local [WordPress meetup group in Buffalo][2] (a fine group of folks, if you’re ever in the area).

The talk was streamed live and recorded, thanks to the power of Google Hangouts on Air. I’ve trimmed the fat out of the video and put it on our YouTube channel for you to see after the jump. Take a look, and **take your first step toward unlocking the full potential of the WordPress admin panel!**

Be sure to **[check out our new video series][3] that will warm you up** for the ebook, and [sign up to **be alerted when the ebook is ready**][4]—think of it as **your own personal bat signal**.
