At Van Patten Media, we’re thrilled to support the free and open source software community.

As part of our commitment to open source, we strive to release our own software to the community, whenever appropriate and possible.

Here’s what we have currently available:

*   [Amalia][1]: a database-free PHP content management system “for the rest of us”
*   [Rach5][2]: a WordPress theme development boilerplate, that provides “sensible defaults” for WordPress functions and makes (essentially) no style choices for the end user

Feel free to contribute on Github. We’ll have more information and more projects in the coming weeks and months!

Thanks,

**The Van Patten Media Team**
