Hey there VPMers! Welcome to this week’s Van Patten Media Week In Review. It’s amazing I’ve been able to put these together consistently now for three weeks. Go me!

This week was a little slower than usual, as we took some time to relax and plan for the weeks ahead. I also took time to organize photos and video from my January trip to Italy–one of my photos is to the right, showing one of the best preserved Roman [Discobolus][2] statues in the world.

Still, we got some cool sites launched, and had plenty of time to find some cool content to share with you. So without any further delay, here’s what we’ve been working on and enjoying over the past 7 days.

### This week…

*   **Wednesday, February 7:** We launched a new website for actress, comedienne, and future star [Julia Nathan][3]. We infused Julia’s personality into this site, creating a fun collage that she’ll be able to maintain for months and years go come.
*   **Thursday February 9:** We finished up the full website for [35mm][4], the “musical exhibition” by composer/lyricist Ryan Scott Oliver inspired by the oeuvre of photographer Matthew Murphy. Stay tuned for more about the show in the coming weeks!

### We liked…

Chris:

*   I’m a sucker for architecture that emphasizes beautiful views, and the [Syncline House][5] is designed to do just that.
*   I am hugely proud of [Andrew Keenan-Bolger][6] and the success of his web series [Submissions Only][7]. AKB was one of our first clients, and we love seeing all the love his work is getting. This week, Submissions Only was on [Entertainment Weekly’s “Must List”][8] – quite the honor!
*   These [vintage book cover graphics][9] are mind-bogglingly cool. I demand poster-sized prints.
