Total Slider is a free plugin for [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) that lets designers build beautiful animated sliders while keeping them easy for clients to manage in a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" interface.

Initially developed for our own client projects, Total Slider has grown and matured into a fully-featured tool for helping non-technical users easily edit and maintain sliders. The interface is designed to give users an accurate preview of how their slide will appear on the front-end of their website, to minimize mistakes and confusion.

You can [download Total Slider](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/total-slider/) or help [contribute to its development at Github](https://github.com/vanpattenmedia/total-slider).
