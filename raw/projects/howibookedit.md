The performing arts can be a tricky business to get into, as there's no clear path to entry. Everyone has their own unique story and advice to offer on how to get your first jobs (and your second, third, etc.).

[How I Booked It](http://www.howibookedit.com) interviews leading theatre professionals and asks them these questions, archiving their stories for future thespians to learn from. A consistent interview format makes it easy to compare answers between interviewees, to see how different people respond.
