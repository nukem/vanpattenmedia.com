Van Patten Media is exists thanks to a number of awesome open source technologies and great online services. In no particular order, here’s a (fairly) comprehensive list.

### Hardware

This site–and many of our client sites–are served off a pair of [Linode 768][1]s (referral link).

### Software

The aforementioned Linode VPSs are powered by [Ubuntu][2] (12.04 LTS, if you’re particularly interested). Our legacy VPS (cruella) uses [Apache][3], [suPHP][4], and [MySQL][5] for the full LAMP experience. Our newer VPS (pongo) uses Nginx, php-fpm, MySQL, and Varnish.

 [5]: http://www.mysql.com/

We have a number of security measures in place, but perhaps chief among them is [Tripwire][6]. Uptime is monitored with [Pingdom][7].

### VanPattenMedia.com

VanPattenMedia.com is powered by [WordPress][8] (the latest stable release). We are proud WordPress users.

This theme is built on top of [Rach5][9] (with the [rach5-helper][10] plugin), our WordPress theme boilerplate built around DRY development techniques and easy upgradability. CSS is generated by [Sass][11], [Compass][12] and an assortment of handy plugins ([rgbapng][13] most notably). As of April 2012, we use the [Skeleton][14] framework, lightly modified and adapted for our specific needs. All markup is HTML5-compliant, based on current revisions of the in-development spec.

The [Signika Negative][15] font is served by [Google Web Fonts][16]. We also use the SIL-licensed icon font [IconicStroke][17], available at [Font Squirrel][18].
